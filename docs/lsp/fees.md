# Fees

## Just-in-time channels service

Our 0-conf channel service currently charges the following fees, in low fee environments:

| Event                                      | Fee           |
| -----------------------------------------  | ------------- |
| New Channel Open (up to 1m sats)           | 10,000 sats   |
| New Channel Open (1m - 5m sats)            | 1%            |
| Wrapped invoices without channel opens     | 2 sats        |

In high fee environments, channel open fees will vary based on block space demand. You can visit [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/) to observe the current fee environment on the blockchain.

Also note that zero fee forwarding is only applied to purchased 0-conf channels.
