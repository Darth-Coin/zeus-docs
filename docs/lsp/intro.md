# What's an LSP?

An LSP, or lightning service provider, helps connect users to the Lightning network by opening up payment channels to their nodes. Read more about them [here](https://medium.com/breez-technology/envisioning-lsps-in-the-lightning-economy-832b45871992).

ZEUS has its own LSP integrated into its mobile wallet. It is now also used by many third-party wallets like [Alby Hub](https://albyhub.com/). You can integrate the ZEUS LSP into your own wallet using our [open APIs](/category/services).

The ZEUS LSP now has [three different services](/category/services).
