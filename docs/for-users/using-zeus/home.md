- On the bottom right corner, we have quick access to the **Camera** to scan QR codes.
- In the middle, we have access to **Lightning** and **On-chain balances**. If you slide them to the right, you get access to **Send** and **Receive** actions.
- At the bottom, we have access to:
  - **Transactions log** (**^**)
  - **LN Channels Management** (üßÆ)
  - **Home Button** (üèõ)
  - **Scan Icon** (üì∑)
  - **Bitcoin Icon**: Tapping this icon will take you to the Keypad Pane view, where you can enter the amount to request or pay an invoice.
