# Overview
ZEUS is an advanced app designed to give you easy access to your Bitcoin Lightning Nodes, NWC wallets, and lndhub accounts.

You can configure ZEUS with multiple nodes and accounts, switching between them instantly without restarting the app.

Managing your home/office LN node from your mobile device with ZEUS has never been easier. This way, you can have full control of your self-custody funds from your own node, privately and securely, wherever you are, anytime.

Keep in mind that ZEUS is not just a Bitcoin Lightning wallet in itself, but an advanced app that connects to your node wallets and accesses the channels so you can manage them directly and remotely.

Another important aspect is that from your ZEUS, you will have full access to all your node funds. So, keep it protected with a PIN. For more privacy when using it in public places, you can activate the option to hide balances.

Another option is to use an lndhub account, also from your own node, with LNBank (BTCpay plugin), LNBits, or LNDhub accounting. This way, you can use only a small fraction of funds (that you decide) from your own LN node liquidity. If your device is lost or stolen, this will not endanger all the node funds (if you haven't activated the security PIN).

It's up to each user how to use ZEUS; you have many options, depending on your use case.
