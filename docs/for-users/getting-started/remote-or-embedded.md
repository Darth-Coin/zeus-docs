# Choose your path

ZEUS is a mobile Bitcoin wallet that can both run a node and wallet locally on your phone, but it can also manage multiple remote nodes. You can connect various nodes not just one, and even use the embedded node in parralel, depending on your needs and usage.

# Embedded node

If you don't have a remote node or account to connect to, you can also use our [embedded node](/category/embedded-node), which will run on your phone. This is the simpler path that most people will choose.

# Remote connections

ZEUS supports connections for LND and CLN nodes, and lndhub accounts, through different types of platforms, networks, configurations etc.

[Please choose your specific node platform](/category/remote-connections/) to see more details about how to configure your remote connection.
